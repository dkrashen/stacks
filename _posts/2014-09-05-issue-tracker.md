If you haven't already taken advantage of it, please take a look at [the
class's issue-tracker system][issues]. We will be using this space to
communicate with each other about any confusing issues which come up while
reading as well as to keep track of any typographical errors
in this prelinary draft of [Martin Olsson's][martin] textbook.
